# App updates and branches

Open **⋮ → Updates**. The larger popup shows the installed version, saved channel, and two channel
buttons: Main (stable) and Testing (experimental). The update source is fixed to
this project; there is no editable repository field. Older saved repository
overrides are ignored.
Entering Testing requires accepting an experimental-features warning. The choice
is saved outside the installation and survives restarts and updates. **Check for updates** reads GitHub Releases over HTTPS. Testing builds
use prereleases such as `testing-v2.4.3`; stable builds use tags such as `v2.4.2` and channel `main`.
The newest release in that channel must have the asset for this device. The app
can return to an older Main version.

An empty repository or missing channel releases says **No testing releases have
been published yet**. Errors and unpublished releases never say “up to date.”
Private repositories need a distribution solution with authentication; this
personal app uses public release downloads and stores no GitHub access tokens.

**Checking without GitHub's API limit.** Unauthenticated GitHub API calls are limited to 60
per hour for each network, shared by every device and tool on it. Each publish therefore also
uploads `channel.json` to a fixed `testing-channel` / `main-channel` prerelease, with the
newest release's assets, sizes and SHA-256 digests. **Check for updates** reads that file as
an ordinary download, which the API limit does not apply to. Only if it is missing does the app
call the API, sending the saved ETag so an unchanged list costs nothing. If GitHub still refuses,
the app uses the last saved list, or says when the limit resets.

**Update size.** Each release also publishes a small
`DeckDriverStation-<version>-App-<base>.tar.gz` holding only the app code (well under 1 MB).
`<base>` fingerprints what an installed copy keeps when only the code changes: the Electron
version and the launchers. An install whose `app/build.json` base matches downloads just
that package; anything else (an Electron upgrade, installs from before 2.4.18) downloads the
full package for its platform. The dialog shows the exact size GitHub lists for the chosen
asset before you download, and the progress counts against that size. A code-only update is
rebuilt locally from this install's own runtime and then installed exactly like a full one.

**Icons.** Windows shortcuts point at a versioned `icons\deck-<version>.ico`, and the update
helper repoints Desktop, Start menu and pinned taskbar shortcuts and refreshes the shell icon
cache. Linux refreshes the menu icon copy and desktop entries; macOS refreshes the bundle icon
and re-registers the app with LaunchServices.

Windows keeps previous versioned icon files so cached, pinned and OneDrive-synced
shortcuts can still resolve them. Each updated shortcut also gets an explicit shell
refresh notification.

**Download update** checks the GitHub asset SHA-256 digest (or its exact matching
`.sha256` file), size, and repository/release URL. Failed downloads are discarded.
After verification, the same action automatically extracts a new copy, validates its app name/version/runtime,
and starts a helper that waits for this app to exit. The helper keeps the previous
app under the update's staging folder, replaces the installed files, and restarts.
Saved robots, browser sessions, and operating-system Wi-Fi profiles remain outside
the replaced installation. Helpers write `install.log` in the staging folder.
Opening Updates closes the active robot page and transport.

Desktop in-app installation requires an installed/packaged app; development
checkouts are protected from replacement. Apple Silicon updates are ad-hoc signed locally, like the initial installation.

## Publishing later

The remote is `https://github.com/AloeVeraZ/SteamDeck-RobotController.git`.
Main and Testing are published branches; Main publishes stable releases (v2.4.22 and later). New work
continues on Testing until promotion is requested. Initial install commands always
read `main/install.sh` or `main/install.ps1` and resolve the newest stable release,
so users can reuse the same command for future versions. No separate download
website or laptop server is involved. After installation, users can choose Testing
from **⋮ → Updates**, accept its warning, and return to Main whenever needed.

After the user authorizes publication:

1. Push the approved branches. Set GitHub's default branch to testing while work
   continues there. Do not merge into main without explicit instruction.
2. Bump the `package.json` version. Testing packages keep `updateChannel: "testing"`.
3. Run the **Publish app update (manual)** workflow on testing. It tests, builds
   Steam Deck/Windows/Apple Silicon, and publishes all three platforms' assets plus
   checksums as a prerelease only after every build succeeds. It never runs on
   a normal branch push; pushing the tag `testing-v<version>` (on testing) or
   `v<version>` (on main) also starts it, so no GitHub sign-in is needed.
   An already published version/tag must not be reused.
4. Main publication requires an explicitly approved promotion and changing the
   packaged update channel to main. Testing builds keep their testing channel.

GitHub branch changes alone are not installable releases. The updater never runs
`git pull` against an installed app or pretends an unpublished commit is an update.
