 * YOUR mechanism code for the autonomous actions (intake, shooter, arm...). Deck Driver Station

 * the rest. Each method is called every loop while its action runs and returns true when finished
 * (RouteActions.java has the rules and the current list of actions).
 *
 * After you add or rename an action in the simulator and export again, its method appears in
 * RouteActions.java: copy it here (keep @Override) and write the code. Delete methods for actions
 * you removed.
